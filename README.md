# Speech-To-Text
This is used to convert audio to text. I developed this as part of my fun projects.
I have used telegram bot to fetch audio files.Currently this works for only .oga files.

1.  Fetch last audio file using telegram bot.
2.  Convert file extension from .oga to .wav
3.  Use speech recognition library to get the audio text.
4.  Send the converted text back to user via bot.
